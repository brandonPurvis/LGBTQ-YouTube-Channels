  u'description': u'My work focuses on insights to be found across transgender sociology, public health, psychiatry, history of medicine, cognitive science, the social processes of science, transgender feminism, and human rights, taking an analytic approach that intersects these many perspectives and is guided by the lived experiences of transgender people. The importance of real, concrete support is a guiding value to me, and I\'m passionate about community health resources and outreach. I live in Orlando with my family, and work chiefly in technical writing. You can find my earlier articles at http://genderanalysis.net/articles/, and keep an eye out for my new book, "Gender Synthesis: Understanding Gender and Complex Systems in Society", coming in 2017. \n\nTo help support my video series on trans topics, go to https://www.patreon.com/zinniajones.

So often in movies & tv shows, you rarely see people w/ disabilities, & when you do it's typically for pity or to inspire non-disabled people. We're never really seen as full fledged multi-faceted human beings, but SPOILERS: we are! So watch, comment, and all that fun stuff and let's do this :)\n\nAbout the host: Michele is a quirky, intuitive, geek-proud, queer (read: bi) vegan human on wheels (read: wheelchair) who does her best to strike a balance between her three passions in life: activism, being creative and spirituality. \nCONNECT WITH THE SHOW\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RebelWheelsNYCShow/\nYoutube: http://tinyurl.com/RebelWheelsNYCShow\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/RebelWheelsNYC\nTumblr: http://rebelwheelsnycshow.tumblr.com/",

I decided one night after going to a local LGBT club for Drag Night to upload my first vlog.  When I woke up the next morning I had a few very encouraging comments at a time where I definitely needed the support.  YouTube became an outlet for me.  \n    \n Since then both YouTube and the online transgender community has grown by leaps and bounds.

  u'description': u'Welcome to my channel! My name is Graeden (call me Grae), and it\'s also Grace - because I\'m genderfluid, and yes. That\'s a thing. Not a make believe thing, an actual thing.\n\nWhich is exactly what I like to talk about! Gender is crazy, it\'s something that seems so inherent and natural but really isn\'t! So let\'s talk about that! \nGender, lifestyle, fashion, life in general - and how they all interplay - I suppose that\'s what you could say this channel is all about!\n\nNeed to contact me for any "business enquiries"? Check out the email below!',
