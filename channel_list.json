I live in Orlando with my family, and work chiefly in technical writing.

My name is Michele, I am proudly #DisabledAF & together w/ my wheelchair Betty, I do a youtube show called Rebelwheels NYC where we discuss all things disability, including ableism, identity, pride & more! \n\nI started this because I wanted to represent & connect w/ my peoples. I wanted to find my peoples & my voice in my disability identity / activism.  So, come hang out! This is about community\n\nAbout the host: I'm a quirky, intuitive, geek-proud, queer (read: bi) vegan human on wheels (read: wheelchair) who does my best to strike a balance between my three passions in life: activism, being creative and spirituality. #IntersectionalOrBust\n\nCONNECT:\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/RebelWheelsNYCShow/\nYOUTUBE: http://tinyurl.com/RebelWheelsNYCShow\nTWITTER: http://twitter.com/RebelWheelsNYC\nTUMBLR: http://rebelwheelsnycshow.tumblr.com/\nWHAT IS ABLEISM?
